/**
 * The lens model (S4): a very subtle, physically exact depth of field for the close heroes, made by
 * jittering the camera over the lens aperture inside the offline accumulation (Engine.renderAccumulated)
 * — no depth buffer, no gather blur, no tilt-shift. Every sub-sample moves the pinhole to a point of the
 * aperture disc (in the camera's right / up plane) and shifts the view window so the plane at the focus
 * distance projects to the same pixels; the running average of the sub-samples is the thin-lens image.
 *
 * The aperture scales with the focus distance (`A = K·F/N`, radius), so the blur is a property of the
 * frame (a fraction of its height), never of the world scale: the blur disc of a point at infinity is
 *   coc∞ = A / (F·tan(fov/2)) = K / (N·tan(fov/2))      (diameter, fraction of the frame height)
 * K puts coc∞ at COC_REF for f/5.6 behind a 20° lens; it is clamped at COC_CAP whatever the f-stop
 * (C1: "keep any depth of field very subtle — the bigatures were shot deep-focus").
 *
 * Pure function of (SceneState, sub-sample index, spp, frame height): deterministic, no history.
